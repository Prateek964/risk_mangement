<div class="theory" markdown="1">

## Credit Risk 

Credit Risk refers to the risk of default on a debt or loan that may arise if the borrower fails to make thee required payments. These defaults may be partial or complete and depends upon several factors, such as the nature of the loan, the credit worthiness of the borrower and the macroeconomic scenarios.   

Credit defaults lead to huge losses to banks and there are several guidelines and regulations which are put in place to ensure that the loans are given after ensuring the credit worthiness of the borrowers. These regulations also enforces banks to maintain a minimum capital to protect its depositors from liquidity risk in case there are major defaults which may lead to a deficiency of liquidity in the bank's funds.
