## Introduction

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

In this unit, we will cover Python and see how we can use it to write programs for building quantitative models such as those for CAPM, Regression Analysis, Options Pricing and VaR Calculation. 

Although Python is not part of FRM I syllabus, we have still incorporated it as an essential component in our course so that students can understand the applications of various topics that we study and how these are used in industry. Here, we present a very simple implementation which may not be an exact representation of how things actually work in Financial firms, but it will give you an idea of the same.
