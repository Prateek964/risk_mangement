## Series

A series represents the sum of all the terms of a sequence. The number of terms can be finite or infinite. Some common example include Arithmetic Series and Geometric Series. We have already seen the formula for both Arithmetic Series and Geometric Series above.

### Arithmetic Series

$$ Arithmetic \text{ } Series, S_n = \dfrac{n}{2}[2a+ (n-1)d ]$$

### Geometric Series

$$ Geometric \text{ } Series, S_n = a \left( \dfrac{r^n-1}{r-1} \right)$$
