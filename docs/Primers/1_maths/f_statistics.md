## Statistics

Statistics deals with data. To understand the structure of the data, we calculate certain metrics such as mean, variance and standard deviation.

<div class="subtheory" markdown="1">

### Mean

The mean of a given set of numbers is the average of those numbers, and is calculated as the sum of the numbers divided by total number of values.

### Variance

Variance measures the spread between numbers in a data set. Mathematically, it is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.

### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation represents the distance from the mean, unlike variance, which gives the rough idea of spread.

Standard deviation is calculated as square root of the variance.

### Frequency Distribution

Frequency distribution displays the frequency of various outcomes in a sample. A histogram is the most commonly used graph to show frequency distributions. It uses vertical columns to show frequencies (how many times each score occurs) and no gaps between the bars.
