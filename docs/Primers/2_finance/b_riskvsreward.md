## Risk vs Reward

Usually, whenever we invest our money, there is always some risk attached to it that we may not get back our money and the returns which were promised to us. Therefore, the reward (return on our investment) comes at the price of risk. As a general rule of thumb, more the risk, more rhe reward.

To quantify rewards and risk, we calculate returns and standard deviation respectively.  
Thus, risk corresponds to standard deviation and rewards correspond to returns that we get.
