## Money

Someone once said, "Money can not buy everything, but it can buy most of the things". The extend to which this holds true is highly subjective and debatable but something which we all can unanimously agree to is that money plays an important role in functioning of economies on scale.

We need money for transactions, to buy commodities of daily use or to purchase real estate. The more money we have, the more physical assets and materialistic pleasures of life we can acquire. Not only that, it also provides a financial support in case of any unfortunate events. Due to above and several other reasons, people tend to increase the amount of money that they have. To do the same, they invest their money in several ways, for example, by buying stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.
