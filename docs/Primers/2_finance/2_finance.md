## Introduction

Any individual or a firm tries to generate more money on their investments. This additional amount is captured via returns. This return has an associated component of risk. As an individual, individuals want to invest such that their risk adjusted return can be maximized.

As a bank, it needs to hold a fixed amount of mimimum risk weighted assets (RWA), to ensure that it can meet the regulatory requirements.
