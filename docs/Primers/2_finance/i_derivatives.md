## Derivatives

A derivative is a financial security whose value is derived from an underlying asset or group of assets.

<div class="subtheory" markdown="1">

### Underlying 

An underlying is a specified interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, etc. An underlying may be a price or rate of an asset or liability but is not the asset or liability.

## Variants of Derivatives

Some common variants of derivatives are described below.

<div class="subtheory" markdown="1">

### Forwards

It is a tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today's pre-determined price.

### Futures

Futures are contracts to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a clearing house that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.

### Options

Options are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the strike price, and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date.

- **_European Option_**: In the case of a European option, the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date;

- **_American Option_**: In the case of an American option, the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction.

Options are of two types: Call Option and Put Option.

- **_Call Option_**: The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.
- **_Put Option_**: The buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right.
