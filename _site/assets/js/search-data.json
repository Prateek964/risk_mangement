Although Python is not part of FRM I syllabus, we have still incorporated it as an essential component in our course so that students can understand the applications of various topics that we study and how these are used in industry. Here, we present a very simple implementation which may not be an exact representation of how things actually work in Financial firms, but it will give you an idea of the same. ",

Not only that, it also provides a financial support in case of any unfortunate events. Due to above and several other reasons, people tend to increase the amount of money that they have.

These numbers are known as terms of the sequence and we can use the special order to write a general expression for $n^{th}$ term of the sequence. Most common examples of sequence are Arithmetic Progressions and Geometric Progressions. Arithmetic Progression . An Arithmetic Progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference of any two consecutive terms is a constant, which is known as the common difference of the sequence. Therefore, the “special order” in an AP is characterized by the common difference $d$ and we can write a general expression for the $n^{th}$ term if we know the common difference $d$ and the first term $a$. It can be easily proved that: . | The $n{th}$ term of an AP is given by: | . $$ a_n = a + (n-1)d $$ . | The sum of first $n$ terms of an AP is given by: | . $$ S_n = \\dfrac{n}{2}[2a+ (n-1)d ] $$ . | If the number of terms in the AP is finite and equal to $n$, then we can $S_n$ in terms of $n$, $a$ and $l$, where $l$ represents the last term and is given by $a + (n-1)d $, as below: | . $$ S_n = \\dfrac{n}{2} (a+l) $$ .

Similarly, there can be another function circumferenceCircle which maps the radius of a circle to its circumference. Note: Functions have many other interesting properties as well but these are not required for this course so we will skip these. Next, we will discuss briefly about the two most commonly used functions in Quantitative Finance, the exponential function and logarithmic function. Both these funcitons are inverse of each other. Exponential Function . The general exponential function is given by: . $$ f(x) = a^x, $$ . where $a$ is a constant. Note that: . 1) When $a=1$, $f(x)$ has a constant value of 1. 2) When $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $f(x)$ decreases exponentially as $x$ increases. 3) When $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $f(x)$ increases exponentially as $x$ decreases. The natural exponential function is given by: . $$ f(x) = e^x $$ . where $e$ is “Euler’s Number”, given by 2.72. Logarithmic Function . To understand the logarithms, let us ask ourselves the question that how many times do we have to multiply 2 to itself to get 8? . Well, since $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8 $, so the asnswer is 3. We write this as $log_2(8) = 3$ . Therefore, $ log_b(x) =y $ implies that $b^y=x$ . Some properties of Logarithms: . 1) $ log_b(xy) = log_b x + log_b y $ 2) $ log_b \\left( \\dfrac{x}{y} \\right) = log_b x - log_b y $ 3) $ log_b (x^p) = p log_b x $ . ",

    "title": "Calculus",
    "content": "The word Calculus is derived from Latin meaning “small stone”. This is so because Calculus helps us in understanding continuous changes by looking at smaller pieces. Differential Calculus cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes. For example, during a racing competition, a car’s velocity is not constant throughout the race, it keeps on changing from time to time. Therefore, we can find the instantaneous velocity at any time by dividing the distance covered by the car in a very short time by the time duration. Integral Calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together to find how much there is. Consider a stick of varying density across its length. Then, we can use integral calculus to find the center of mass of the stick. The similar concept is also used to find the expected value, also known as mean, of a probability distribution. Curve . A curve is a continuous and smooth flowing line without any sharp turns. One way to recognize a curve is that it bends and changes its direction at least once. For example, the graph of $y=x^2$ and $y=e^x$ represent curves. Slope . The slope is defined as the ratio of the vertical change between two points, the rise, to the horizontal change between the same two points, the run. Secant . A secant of a curve is a line that intersects the curve at a minimum of two distinct points. Tangent . A tangent to a curve at a given point is the straight line that “just touches” the curve at that point. Derivative . The derivative of a function at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. | Interpretation: Rate of Change Example: Velocity as the rate of change of displacement . | Calculation: Indicated by slope of the curve, given by $ \\dfrac{dy}{dx} $ . | . 1) Example 1: Let $Y$ = Price of Option = $f(S)$, where $S$= price of Stock, then $\\dfrac{dY}{dS}$ gives delta of the option, one of the 5 1st order Greeks . 2) Example 2: Let $Y$ = Price of Future = $f(S)$, $S$= price of underlying Commodity, then $\\dfrac{dY}{dS}$ gives delta of the Future contract. Taylor’s Series . The Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function’s derivatives at a single point. For example, if $f(x)$ is diffrentiable at $x=a$, then we can write $f(x)$ as, . $$f(x) = f(a) + \\dfrac{f^{‘}(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \\dfrac{f^{“}(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + …$$ . or, . $$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n $$ . Integral . Integral represents a numerical value equal to the area under the graph of a function for some interval (definite integral) or a new function the derivative of which is the original function (indefinite integral).

Strings . Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes. # Creating a string using single quotes mystring = 'hello' print(mystring) # Creating a string using double quotes mystring = \"hello\" print(mystring) # Strings can be concatenated using + operator helloworld = \"hello\" + \" \" + \"world\" print(helloworld) # Length of strings can be found using len() function print(len(helloworld)) Just press 'Run'. Lists . Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as we wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list. mylist = [] mylist.append(1) mylist.append(2) mylist.append(3) print(mylist[0]) # prints 1 print(mylist[1]) # prints 2 print(mylist[2]) # prints 3 # prints out 1,2,3 for x in mylist: print(x) # Lists can be concatenated using + operator, similar to strings my_numbers = [1,3,5,7]+ [2,4,6,8] print(my_numbers) # Length of lists can be found using len() function, similar to strings print(len(my_numbers)) Just press 'Run'. Dictionaries . A dictionary is a data type similar to lists, but works with keys and values instead of indexes. Each value stored in a dictionary can be accessed using a key, which is any type of object (a string, a number, a list, etc.) instead of using its index to address it. Dictionaries can be iterated over using the key value pairs. Unlike a list, does not keep the order of the values stored in it. # Creating a phonebook dictionary phonebook = {} phonebook[\"John\"] = 938477566 phonebook[\"Jack\"] = 938377264 phonebook[\"Jill\"] = 947662781 print(phonebook) # Creating the same dictionary using a different syntax phonebook = { \"John\" : 938477566, \"Jack\" : 938377264, \"Jill\" : 947662781 } print(phonebook) # Iterating over the phonebook dictionary for name, number in phonebook.items(): print(\"Phone number of %s is %d\" % (name, number)) Just press 'Run'.

Variance measures the spread between numbers in a data set. Mathematically, it is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. Standard Deviation . Standard deviation represents the distance from the mean, unlike variance, which gives the rough idea of spread. Standard deviation is calculated as square root of the variance. Frequency Distribution . Frequency distribution displays the frequency of various outcomes in a sample. A histogram is the most commonly used graph to show frequency distributions.

A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a clearing house that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves. Options . Options are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the strike price, and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. | European Option: In the case of a European option, the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; . | American Option: In the case of an American option, the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. | . Options are of two types: Call Option and Put Option. | Call Option: The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. | Put Option: The buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. | . Swaps . Swaps are contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, commodities exchange, stocks or other assets.

The risk that the government entity or company that issued the bond will run into financial difficulties and won’t be able to pay the interest or repay the principal at maturity. Credit risk applies to debt investments such as bonds. Liquidity Risk: . The risk of being unable to sell your investment at a fair price and get your money out when you want to. The two types of Liquidity Risk include asset liquidity and funding liquidity. Operational Risk .
