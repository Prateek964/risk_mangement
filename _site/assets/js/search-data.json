The APT was initially proposed by Professor Stephen Ross in 1976. Unlike CAPM, APT does not assume investors hold efficient portfolios and does not assume risk aversion. Instead, APT has three underlying assumptions: i) Asset returns can be explained by systematic factors that affect all securities. ii) Investors can eliminate specific (or idiosyncratic) risk from their portfolios by using diversification, iii) There are no arbitrage opportunities among well-diversified portfolios. Investors would exploit them away any such arbitrage opportunities, if they were to exist. APT defines the structure of returns but does not define which factors should be used in the model. The CAPM is a special case of APT with only one factor exposure: the market risk premium. The Fama-French three-factor model describes returns as a linear function of the market index return, firm size, and book-to-market factors. Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) . ",

An Arithmetic Progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference of any two consecutive terms is a constant, which is known as the common difference of the sequence.

Sell a short-dated option and buy a long-dated option. Investor profits if stock price stays in a narrow range. | Butterfly Spread: Three different options: buy one call with low exercise price, buy another with a high exercise price, and buy short two calls with an exercise price in between. Butterfly spread buyer is betting the stock price will stay near the price of the written calls. | Diagonal Spread: Similar to a calendar spread except the options can have different strike prices in addition to different expirations. | Box Spread: Combination of bull call spread and bear put spread on the same asset. This strategy will produce a constant payoff that is equal to the high exercise price minus the low exercise price. | . Vertical Option Spread trades: Bull Spread and Bear Spread .

Similarly, there can be another function circumferenceCircle which maps the radius of a circle to its circumference. Note: Functions have many other interesting properties as well but these are not required for this course so we will skip these. Next, we will discuss briefly about the two most commonly used functions in Quantitative Finance, the exponential function and logarithmic function. Both these funcitons are inverse of each other. Exponential Function . The general exponential function is given by: . $$ f(x) = a^x, $$ . where $a$ is a constant. Note that: . 1) When $a=1$, $f(x)$ has a constant value of 1. 2) When $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $f(x)$ decreases exponentially as $x$ increases. 3) When $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $f(x)$ increases exponentially as $x$ decreases. The natural exponential function is given by: . $$ f(x) = e^x $$ . where $e$ is “Euler’s Number”, given by 2.72. Logarithmic Function . To understand the logarithms, let us ask ourselves the question that how many times do we have to multiply 2 to itself to get 8? . Well, since $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8 $, so the asnswer is 3. We write this as $log_2(8) = 3$ . Therefore, $ log_b(x) =y $ implies that $b^y=x$ . Some properties of Logarithms: . 1) $ log_b(xy) = log_b x + log_b y $ 2) $ log_b \\left( \\dfrac{x}{y} \\right) = log_b x - log_b y $ 3) $ log_b (x^p) = p log_b x $ . ",

    "doc": "d. Calculus",
    "title": "Calculus",
    "content": "The word Calculus is derived from Latin meaning “small stone”. This is so because Calculus helps us in understanding continuous changes by looking at smaller pieces. Differential Calculus cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes. For example, during a racing competition, a car’s velocity is not constant throughout the race, it keeps on changing from time to time. Therefore, we can find the instantaneous velocity at any time by dividing the distance covered by the car in a very short time by the time duration. Integral Calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together to find how much there is. Consider a stick of varying density across its length. Then, we can use integral calculus to find the center of mass of the stick. The similar concept is also used to find the expected value, also known as mean, of a probability distribution. Curve . A curve is a continuous and smooth flowing line without any sharp turns. One way to recognize a curve is that it bends and changes its direction at least once. For example, the graph of $y=x^2$ and $y=e^x$ represent curves. Slope . The slope is defined as the ratio of the vertical change between two points, the rise, to the horizontal change between the same two points, the run. Secant . A secant of a curve is a line that intersects the curve at a minimum of two distinct points. Tangent . A tangent to a curve at a given point is the straight line that “just touches” the curve at that point. Derivative . The derivative of a function at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. | Interpretation: Rate of Change Example: Velocity as the rate of change of displacement . | Calculation: Indicated by slope of the curve, given by $ \\dfrac{dy}{dx} $ . | . 1) Example 1: Let $Y$ = Price of Option = $f(S)$, where $S$= price of Stock, then $\\dfrac{dY}{dS}$ gives delta of the option, one of the 5 1st order Greeks . 2) Example 2: Let $Y$ = Price of Future = $f(S)$, $S$= price of underlying Commodity, then $\\dfrac{dY}{dS}$ gives delta of the Future contract. Taylor’s Series . The Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function’s derivatives at a single point. For example, if $f(x)$ is diffrentiable at $x=a$, then we can write $f(x)$ as, . $$f(x) = f(a) + \\dfrac{f^{‘}(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \\dfrac{f^{“}(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + …$$ . or, . $$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n $$ . Integral . Integral represents a numerical value equal to the area under the graph of a function for some interval (definite integral) or a new function the derivative of which is the original function (indefinite integral).

Variance measures the spread between numbers in a data set. Mathematically, it is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. Standard Deviation . Standard deviation represents the distance from the mean, unlike variance, which gives the rough idea of spread. Standard deviation is calculated as square root of the variance.

A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a clearing house that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves. Options . Options are contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the strike price, and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. | European Option: In the case of a European option, the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; . | American Option: In the case of an American option, the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. | . Options are of two types: Call Option and Put Option. | Call Option: The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. | Put Option: The buyer of a put option has the right to sell a certain quantity of an underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no obligation to carry out this right. | .

The four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk. Credit Risk . The risk that the government entity or company that issued the bond will run into financial difficulties and won’t be able to pay the interest or repay the principal at maturity. Credit risk applies to debt investments such as bonds. Liquidity Risk: . The risk of being unable to sell your investment at a fair price and get your money out when you want to. The two types of Liquidity Risk include asset liquidity and funding liquidity. Operational Risk . It is the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment. Model Risk .

Step 2: Determine the appropriate discount rate. The approximate discount rate can be either the bond’s yield to maturity (YTM) or a series of spot rates. Step 3: Calculate the PV of the estimated cash flows. The PV is determined by discounting the bond’s cash flow stream by the appropriate discount rate(s). | . Clean and Dirty Bond Prices .
